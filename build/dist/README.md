## Claude Code Integration

This MCP server is specifically enhanced for **Claude Code** workflows:

### Research-Driven Development
- **Code Pattern Discovery**: Find algorithm implementations in research papers
- **Citation Management**: Generate properly formatted references for your projects
- **Research Documentation**: Extract and organize findings from academic sources

### Common Workflows

#### 1. Algorithm Research
```bash
# Search for papers on a topic
"Find recent papers on transformer architectures"

# Download relevant papers
"Download the first 3 papers from the search results"

# Search for implementation patterns
"Search for 'class Transformer' in downloaded papers"
```

#### 2. Literature Review
```bash
# Collect papers on a research area
"Search for papers by Yoshua Bengio on deep learning"

# Generate bibliography
"Create a BibTeX bibliography from the downloaded paper DOIs"

# Extract key concepts
"Search for 'attention mechanism' implementations"
```

#### 3. Code Documentation
```bash
# Find reference implementations
"Search for 'def attention' in my research papers"

# Generate proper citations
"Create IEEE format citations for papers containing this algorithm"
```

### Integration Tips

1. **Set up downloads directory**: Configure a dedicated research papers directory
2. **Use regex patterns**: Leverage powerful pattern matching for code discovery  
3. **Batch operations**: Process multiple papers efficiently with the bibliography tool
4. **Context awareness**: Use context lines to understand code snippets better
