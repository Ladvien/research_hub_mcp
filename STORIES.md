# Rust Sci-Hub MCP Server - Jira Stories

## Epic: RSH-1 - Build Rust-based MCP Server for Sci-Hub Integration

**Description:** Create a production-ready MCP server in Rust that provides search, download, and metadata extraction capabilities for academic papers through Sci-Hub, designed to run as a background service on macOS.

**Business Value:** Enable researchers to efficiently access academic papers for CS architecture and research through a standardized MCP interface.

## Story: RSH-15 - Security Audit and Hardening

**Priority:** High  
**Story Points:** 3  
**Component:** Security  

**Description:**
Conduct comprehensive security audit and implement security hardening measures for the rust-sci-hub-mcp server to ensure safe operation in user environments.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] Input validation and sanitization for all user inputs
- [ ] Secure HTTP client configuration with proper SSL/TLS
- [ ] File system permissions and access controls
- [ ] Credential management and secure storage
- [ ] Network security considerations and recommendations
- [ ] Dependency vulnerability scanning and updates
- [ ] Security logging and audit trail
- [ ] Rate limiting and abuse prevention
- [ ] Memory safety verification
- [ ] Security testing and penetration testing

**Technical Requirements:**
- Use cargo-audit for dependency vulnerability scanning
- Implement input validation using validator crate
- Configure HTTP client with secure defaults
- Use secure random number generation
- Implement proper file permissions (0600 for config files)
- Add security headers for HTTP responses
- Use structured logging for security events
- Implement request rate limiting
- Follow Rust security best practices

**Dependencies:**
- All functional stories (RSH-3 through RSH-12)

**Definition of Done:**
- [ ] Security audit identifies no critical vulnerabilities
- [ ] All inputs are properly validated and sanitized
- [ ] HTTP security best practices are implemented
- [ ] File permissions follow principle of least privilege
- [ ] Security testing passes all checks
- [ ] Dependency vulnerabilities are addressed
- [ ] Security documentation is complete
- [ ] Penetration testing results are satisfactory

**Test Requirements:**
- Security testing for input validation
- Tests for file permission security
- Network security testing
- Dependency vulnerability scanning
- Memory safety verification
- Authentication and authorization testing
