## Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks
1. **API Rate Limits**: Implement circuit breakers and fallback providers
2. **XML Parsing Complexity**: Use battle-tested parsers, extensive test coverage
3. **Deduplication Accuracy**: Multiple algorithms, confidence scoring, manual review
4. **Network Failures**: Retry logic, caching, graceful degradation
5. **Memory Usage**: Streaming responses, bounded channels, pagination

### Process Risks  
1. **API Access Delays**: Start registration early, have backup providers
2. **Integration Complexity**: Incremental integration, feature flags
3. **Testing Coverage**: Automated tests, mocked APIs, staging environment
4. **Performance Regression**: Continuous benchmarking, metrics monitoring
5. **Credential Management**: Secure vault, environment separation

---

## Success Metrics

### Technical Metrics
- API response time P95 < 500ms
- Deduplication accuracy > 95%
- System availability > 99.9%
- Cache hit ratio > 80%

## Notes for Implementation

1. Start with free, no-auth providers for quick wins
2. Implement caching early to reduce API calls
3. Design for extensibility - new providers should be easy to add
4. Monitor rate limits carefully to avoid service disruption
5. Use feature flags for gradual rollout
6. Prioritize providers with best documentation
7. Build comprehensive test suite from day one
8. Document API quirks and workarounds
9. Plan for API version changes
10. Keep credentials secure at all times
