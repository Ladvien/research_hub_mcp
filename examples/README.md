## üîß Advanced Configuration

### Multi-Domain Research Setup

```toml
[research_source]
# Optimize for multi-disciplinary research
max_results_per_provider = 15
timeout_secs = 45
concurrent_searches = 5

# Provider-specific settings
[research_source.provider_config]
arxiv_priority_boost = 5  # Extra boost for physics/CS
pubmed_priority_boost = 10  # Extra boost for biomedical
semantic_scholar_api_key = "your-api-key"  # For higher rate limits
```

### High-Volume Research Setup

```toml
[downloads]
directory = "~/Research/Papers"
max_concurrent = 5
timeout_secs = 120
organize_by_date = true
organize_by_subject = true

[research_source]
max_results_per_provider = 25
parallel_provider_calls = true
aggressive_caching = true
```

### Privacy-Focused Setup

```toml
[server]
# Use local-only configuration
host = "127.0.0.1"
disable_telemetry = true

[research_source]
# Minimize external calls
max_results_per_provider = 5
respect_robots_txt = true
user_agent = "Academic Research Tool"
```

## üö® Troubleshooting Examples

### Common Issues and Solutions

**Issue:** "No results found"
```
Possible causes:
1. Query too specific - try broader terms
2. Spelling errors - check query spelling
3. Provider temporary issues - check logs

Solution: Try alternative queries or check provider status
```

**Issue:** "Download failed"
```
Possible causes:
1. Paper not freely available
2. Network connectivity issues
3. Provider rate limiting

Solution: System will try multiple providers automatically
```

**Issue:** "Connection timeout"
```
Possible causes:
1. Slow network connection
2. Provider server issues
3. Firewall blocking requests

Solution: Increase timeout in configuration
```

## üìä Performance Optimization

### Search Performance Tips

1. **Use Specific Terms:** "BERT transformer" vs "machine learning"
2. **Leverage Provider Strengths:** arXiv for CS, PubMed for medicine
3. **DOI When Available:** Direct DOI lookup is fastest
4. **Author Search:** Use full names: "Geoffrey Hinton"

### Download Optimization

1. **Parallel Downloads:** Enable concurrent downloads
2. **Provider Fallback:** System automatically tries multiple sources
3. **Resume Support:** Partial downloads can be resumed
4. **Local Caching:** Avoid re-downloading same papers

## üéì Academic Workflow Integration

### Literature Review Workflow

1. **Broad Search:** Start with general terms
2. **Refine Results:** Use filters and specific providers
3. **Follow Citations:** Use DOI lookup for referenced papers
4. **Organize Downloads:** Use date/subject organization

### Research Project Setup

1. **Create Project Directory:** Organize by research topic
2. **Configure Providers:** Optimize for your field
3. **Set Up Monitoring:** Track download success rates
4. **Regular Updates:** Keep provider list current

## üìã Best Practices

### Ethical Usage

- **Rate Limiting:** Don't overwhelm providers
- **Terms Compliance:** Respect all provider ToS
- **Citation:** Properly cite downloaded papers
- **Legal Access:** Only access papers you have rights to

### Technical Best Practices

- **Regular Updates:** Keep software updated
- **Backup Configuration:** Save working configurations
- **Monitor Logs:** Check for errors and warnings
- **Test Regularly:** Verify provider functionality
