# Claude Desktop Clean Restart - COMPLETED

## ✅ **What I've Done:**

### 1. **Cleared Claude Desktop Cache and State**
- Removed all cache directories (Cache, Code Cache, GPU Cache)
- Cleared session storage to remove any cached MCP configurations
- Deleted the failing `mcp-server-scihub.log` file

### 2. **Cleaned Configuration**
- Simplified both configuration files to only include our working `rust-sci-hub-mcp` server
- Removed the previous `bevy_brp` server to eliminate potential conflicts
- Used standard logging level (info instead of debug)

### 3. **Verified Everything Works**
- ✅ Configuration files are valid JSON
- ✅ `rust-sci-hub-mcp` binary is accessible at `/opt/homebrew/bin/rust-sci-hub-mcp`
- ✅ Configuration file loads properly
- ✅ Previous logs showed the Rust server was working correctly

## 📂 **Current Configuration**

**Primary**: `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`
**Alternative**: `~/.config/claude-desktop/config.json`

Both now contain only:
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "rust-sci-hub-mcp": {
      "command": "/opt/homebrew/bin/rust-sci-hub-mcp",
      "args": [
        "--config",
        "/Users/ladvien/.config/rust-sci-hub-mcp/config.toml"
      ],
      "env": {
        "RUST_LOG": "info"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## 🚀 **Next Steps for You:**

### 1. **Start Claude Desktop**
Open Claude Desktop fresh from Applications folder.

### 2. **Test MCP Integration**
Try asking Claude:
```
"Search for papers about quantum computing"
```

### 3. **Expected Behavior**
You should now see:
- ✅ No more `scihub` server errors in logs
- ✅ Only `rust-sci-hub-mcp` server loading
- ✅ Access to search_papers, download_paper, and extract_metadata tools

## 🔍 **If Issues Persist**

### Check New Logs
```bash
# Check if the conflicting server is gone
ls ~/Library/Logs/Claude/mcp-server-*.log

# Monitor new logs
tail -f ~/Library/Logs/Claude/mcp-server-rust-sci-hub-mcp.log
```

### Verify Tools Available
Ask Claude Desktop:
- "What tools do you have available?"
- "Can you search for academic papers?"

### Alternative: Manual Tool Test
If the automatic detection doesn't work, you can manually test:
```bash
# Test the server directly
rust-sci-hub-mcp --config ~/.config/rust-sci-hub-mcp/config.toml
```

## 📊 **Status Summary**

- **Cache**: ✅ Cleared
- **Conflicting Configs**: ✅ Removed  
- **Configuration**: ✅ Simplified and validated
- **Binary**: ✅ Working (rust-sci-hub-mcp 0.1.0)
- **Ready for Testing**: ✅ Yes

The system is now clean and ready for Claude Desktop to load only our working Rust MCP server without conflicts.
