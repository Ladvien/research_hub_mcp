# Team Coordination Log

## Agent Assignments

**Static Analysis Agent:** CLAIMING: Code quality, lint violations, error handling patterns - STATIC ANALYSIS COMPLETED - 15 QUALITY STORIES GENERATED
**Architecture Agent:** AUDIT-ARCH-001 - Circuit Breaker Integration - COMPLETED
**Security Agent:** CLAIMING: Input validation, HTTP security, file permissions, credential management - SECURITY AUDIT COMPLETED - 11 CRITICAL SECURITY STORIES GENERATED
**Performance Agent:** PERFORMANCE OPTIMIZATION COMPLETED - All high priority performance stories fixed

## Work Distribution
- **Core modules**: main.rs, lib.rs, error.rs
- **Server layer**: server/mod.rs, server/handler.rs, server/transport.rs
- **Tools layer**: tools/* (search, download, metadata, categorize, bibliography)
- **Client layer**: client/* (providers, mirror, rate_limiter, meta_search)
- **Service layer**: service/* (daemon, health, signals, pid)
- **Resilience layer**: resilience/* (circuit_breaker, retry, timeout, health)
- **Config layer**: config/mod.rs

## Compliance Requirements from ARCHITECTURE.md
- Hexagonal architecture with ports/adapters
- Circuit breaker pattern for external calls
- Async/await throughout with proper error handling
- Input validation and sanitization
- Security-first design (file permissions, HTTPS, rate limiting)
- Performance monitoring and metrics
- Comprehensive error handling with thiserror
- Structured logging with tracing

## Architecture Audit Findings (CRITICAL VIOLATIONS IDENTIFIED)

### Critical Architectural Violations:
1. **Circuit Breaker Pattern NOT Implemented** - Circuit breaker exists but is NOT used in any client code
2. **Hexagonal Architecture Violated** - Direct coupling between tools and external services
3. **Missing Repository Pattern** - No data access abstraction layer
4. **Incomplete Command Pattern** - Tools lack proper command abstraction
5. **Poor Dependency Injection** - Tools create their own dependencies instead of receiving them
6. **Layer Bleeding** - Business logic mixed with transport concerns
7. **Missing Strategy Pattern** - Provider selection hardcoded instead of configurable
8. **Incomplete Error Boundary Implementation** - No proper error isolation between layers

### Backlog Stories Generated: 8 high-priority architectural fixes required

## Security Audit Findings (CRITICAL VULNERABILITIES IDENTIFIED)

### Critical Security Vulnerabilities:

1. **HTTP Protocol Usage (CRITICAL)** - ArXiv provider uses HTTP instead of HTTPS
   - File: `/Users/ladvien/sci_hub_mcp/src/client/providers/arxiv.rs:33`
   - Risk: Man-in-the-middle attacks, data interception
   - Impact: Credential disclosure, data tampering

2. **Insecure HTTP Client Configuration (HIGH)** - Multiple HTTP clients lack security hardening
   - Files: All provider files using `Client::builder()`
   - Risk: Missing timeouts, no certificate pinning, weak TLS configuration
   - Impact: DoS attacks, connection hijacking

3. **File Permission Vulnerabilities (HIGH)** - File operations lack proper permission settings
   - Files: `/Users/ladvien/sci_hub_mcp/src/service/pid.rs`, `/Users/ladvien/sci_hub_mcp/src/tools/download.rs`
   - Risk: Unauthorized file access, privilege escalation
   - Impact: Data exposure, system compromise

4. **Dangerous SSL Configuration Option (CRITICAL)** - `danger_accept_invalid_certs` flag exists
   - File: `/Users/ladvien/sci_hub_mcp/src/client/mod.rs:27`
   - Risk: Bypass of certificate validation
   - Impact: Complete TLS security bypass

5. **Excessive Use of .unwrap() (HIGH)** - 150+ instances of potentially panicking code
   - Files: Throughout codebase (tools, clients, services)
   - Risk: Application crashes, denial of service
   - Impact: Service unavailability, data corruption

6. **Input Validation Bypasses (MEDIUM)** - Some validation patterns are incomplete
   - Files: Search and download tools
   - Risk: Path traversal, command injection attempts
   - Impact: File system access, code execution

7. **API Key Exposure Risk (MEDIUM)** - API keys stored in configuration without encryption
   - Files: Provider implementations with api_key fields
   - Risk: Credential exposure in logs/config files
   - Impact: Unauthorized API access, rate limit abuse

### Backlog Stories Generated: 11 high-priority security fixes required**CODE QUALITY AGENT:** CLAIMING AUDIT-STA-001 - Refactoring cognitive complexity in meta_search.rs get_by_doi function
