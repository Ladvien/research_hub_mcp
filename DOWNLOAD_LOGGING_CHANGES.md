3. **Performance Monitoring**: Detailed timing and bandwidth statistics
4. **Security Auditing**: All file system operations and permission checks logged
5. **Provider Debugging**: Understand which sources work for different papers

## Usage

When `RUST_LOG=debug` is set, the download process will generate extensive logs showing:
- Input validation and sanitization
- Provider search results and analysis
- Network request/response details
- File creation and permission setting
- Real-time download progress
- Error context and troubleshooting information

All MCP responses now include enhanced error messages with debugging context and actionable suggestions for users.
