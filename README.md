chmod +x rust-research-mcp

# Move to a permanent location
sudo mv rust-research-mcp /usr/local/bin/
```

### Building from Source

If you prefer to build from source:

```bash
# Prerequisites: Rust 1.70+ (install from https://rustup.rs/)

# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/Ladvien/research_hub_mcp.git
cd research_hub_mcp

# Build the release binary
cargo build --release

# The binary will be at ./target/release/rust-research-mcp
```

### Configuration for Claude Desktop

Add the following to your Claude Desktop configuration file:

**macOS**: `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`
**Windows**: `%APPDATA%\Claude\claude_desktop_config.json`
**Linux**: `~/.config/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "rust-research-mcp": {
      "command": "/usr/local/bin/rust-research-mcp",
      "args": [
        "--download-dir", "~/Downloads/Research-Papers",
        "--log-level", "info"
      ],
      "env": {
        "RUST_LOG": "info"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## Usage

Once configured, you can ask Claude to:

- **Search for papers**: "Search for recent papers on quantum computing"
- **Download papers**: "Download the first paper from the search results"
- **Extract metadata**: "Extract metadata from the PDF file"

### Command Line Options

```bash
rust-research-mcp [OPTIONS]

Options:
  --download-dir <PATH>    Directory for downloaded papers [default: ~/Downloads/papers]
  --log-level <LEVEL>      Log level (error, warn, info, debug, trace) [default: info]
  --config <PATH>          Path to configuration file
  --help                   Print help information
  --version                Print version information
```

### Common Issues

**Issue**: Papers not downloading
- **Solution**: Some papers may not be available through Sci-Hub, especially very recent publications. The tool will provide helpful suggestions for alternatives.

**Issue**: Connection errors
- **Solution**: Check your internet connection and firewall settings. The tool requires access to academic databases.

**Issue**: Claude Desktop not recognizing the server
- **Solution**: Ensure the path in `claude_desktop_config.json` is absolute and the binary has execute permissions.
