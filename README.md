## Installation

### Quick Start (Recommended)

**Download the latest release binary:**

```bash
# macOS (Apple Silicon)
curl -L -o rust-research-mcp https://github.com/Ladvien/research_hub_mcp/releases/latest/download/rust-research-mcp
chmod +x rust-research-mcp

# Move to a permanent location
sudo mv rust-research-mcp /usr/local/bin/
```

### Building from Source

If you prefer to build from source:

```bash
# Prerequisites: Rust 1.70+ (install from https://rustup.rs/)

# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/Ladvien/research_hub_mcp.git
cd research_hub_mcp

# Build the release binary
cargo build --release

# The binary will be at ./target/release/rust-research-mcp
```

### Configuration for Claude Desktop

Add the following to your Claude Desktop configuration file:

**macOS**: `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`
**Windows**: `%APPDATA%\Claude\claude_desktop_config.json`
**Linux**: `~/.config/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "rust-research-mcp": {
      "command": "/usr/local/bin/rust-research-mcp",
      "args": [
        "--download-dir", "~/Downloads/Research-Papers",
        "--log-level", "info"
      ],
      "env": {
        "RUST_LOG": "info"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## Usage

Once configured, you can ask Claude to:

- **Search for papers**: "Search for recent papers on quantum computing"
- **Download papers**: "Download the first paper from the search results"
- **Extract metadata**: "Extract metadata from the PDF file"

### Command Line Options

```bash

src/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ server/          # MCP server implementation
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ tools/           # MCP tools (search, download, metadata)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ client/          # Research source clients
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ providers/   # Source-specific implementations
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ resilience/      # Error handling and retry logic
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ config/          # Configuration management
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Issue**: Papers not downloading
- **Solution**: Some papers may not be available through Sci-Hub, especially very recent publications. The tool will provide helpful suggestions for alternatives.

**Issue**: Connection errors
- **Solution**: Check your internet connection and firewall settings. The tool requires access to academic databases.

**Issue**: Claude Desktop not recognizing the server
- **Solution**: Ensure the path in `claude_desktop_config.json` is absolute and the binary has execute permissions.
