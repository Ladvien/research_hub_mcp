# Enhanced Download Debugging Demo

## Summary

I've successfully enhanced the paper download functionality with extensive debug logging and improved error reporting in MCP responses. Here's what was added:

## üîç Enhanced Debug Logging

### 1. **Download Entry Point (`download_paper`)**
- Input validation logging with parameter details
- Download ID generation tracking
- File path resolution with security checks
- Existing file checks with hash verification logging

### 2. **Source Resolution (`resolve_download_source`)**
- DOI-based search query creation
- Meta-search execution across all providers
- Provider-by-provider result breakdown
- Cascade retrieval attempt logging
- Detailed error path analysis

### 3. **Download Execution (`execute_download`)**
- URL validation and timing tracking
- Progress state initialization
- Content-Length determination
- Resume capability detection
- Request/response header analysis

### 4. **Progress Tracking (`download_with_progress`)**
- Chunk-by-chunk download monitoring
- File creation and security permission setting
- Streaming error detection
- Real-time progress statistics
- Final download completion verification

## üö® Enhanced Error Reporting in MCP

### 1. **Detailed Error Messages**
Now includes:
- Timestamp for debugging correlation
- Error type information
- Debug context for troubleshooting
- Specific suggestions based on error type

### 2. **Success Information Enhancement**
- Download statistics (time, speed)
- File integrity information (SHA256 hash preview)
- File size and location details

### 3. **Error Categories**
- **Paper Not Available**: Detailed provider analysis
- **Network Issues**: Connection troubleshooting
- **Permission Issues**: macOS-specific guidance
- **Generic Failures**: Full error context

## üéØ Debug Levels

- **DEBUG**: Extremely verbose logging for troubleshooting
  - Step-by-step execution flow
  - Parameter validation details
  - Network request/response analysis
  - File system operations

- **INFO**: Key operation milestones
  - Download start/completion
  - Provider search results
  - File creation events

- **WARN**: Recoverable issues
  - Data inconsistencies
  - Fallback operations

- **ERROR**: Critical failures
  - Security violations
  - Unrecoverable errors

## üîß Usage

When a download fails, users now get:
1. **Immediate context** in the MCP response
2. **Detailed debug information** in the logs (if debug logging enabled)
3. **Actionable suggestions** based on error type
4. **Timing information** for performance analysis

## üöÄ Benefits

1. **Faster Debugging**: Comprehensive logs show exactly where failures occur
2. **Better User Experience**: Clear error messages with specific guidance
3. **Performance Monitoring**: Detailed timing and speed statistics
4. **Security Auditing**: File system operations and permission checks logged
5. **Provider Analysis**: Understand which sources work for different papers

The logging is especially verbose at DEBUG level - every step of the download process is tracked with emoji indicators for easy visual parsing.
